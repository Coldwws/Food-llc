                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p><strong>Broiler Chicken:</strong> Raised specifically for meat production, broiler chickens grow quickly and are typically harvested at about 6 to 7 weeks of age. They are tender and flavorful, making them ideal for various cooking methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Roaster Chicken:</strong> Larger than broilers, roaster chickens are typically between 8 to 12 weeks old and have a more developed flavor and texture. They are often roasted whole and served as a centerpiece dish.</p>
                <p><strong>Free-Range Chicken:</strong> These chickens are allowed to roam freely outdoors, resulting in a more natural diet and lifestyle. Many consumers prefer free-range chicken for its perceived health benefits and humane treatment.</p>
                <p><strong>Organic Chicken:</strong> Raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones, organic chickens are fed organic feed and are often raised in more humane conditions. They are popular among health-conscious consumers.</p>
                <p><strong>Heritage Chicken:</strong> These breeds are bred for their traditional traits and are often slower-growing than commercial broilers. They are known for their rich flavor and are favored by chefs who prioritize quality.</p>

                <h2>Beef</h2>
                <p><strong>Grass-Fed Beef:</strong> Beef from cattle that are fed a natural diet of grass and forage. This type of beef is often leaner and has a more pronounced flavor than grain-fed beef.</p>
                <p><strong>Organic Beef:</strong> Raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones, organic beef comes from cattle that are fed organic feed and raised in humane conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Filet Mignon:</strong> A premium cut of beef that is tender and flavorful, often served as a steak. It is ideal for special occasions and fine dining.</p>
